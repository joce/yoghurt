"""Run library coroutines on a dedicated background event loop.

The public sync API is a thin facade over async core functions. Those
coroutines run on one lazily-started daemon thread, which keeps the sync
surface usable inside environments that already run an event loop
(notebooks, agent runtimes) where a naive asyncio.run() would raise.
