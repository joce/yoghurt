"""Run a pytest file and fail if any test in it was skipped.

Run from the repo root:  uv run python -m tools.check_no_skips <pytest arg>...

Used by the ``pandas`` tox env to guarantee that tests/test_frames.py's
positive to_pandas/to_arrow paths (guarded by ``pytest.importorskip``)
actually execute rather than silently skipping because pandas/pyarrow are
missing from the environment. A green run with those tests skipped would be
worse than no env at all, so the check is mechanical rather than eyeballed.
